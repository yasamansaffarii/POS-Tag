Abstract
Labeling speech components is one of the most important basic tasks in natural language processing. For this issue
There are many classification, traditional and deep models. In this article, we tried to combine two architectures
cnn and bilstm extract more important features from text to classify pos tags more accurately
do it. Because by combining two architectures, features are extracted at different levels. Finally, the mentioned model with the model
The basic models and their photo models were compared and the results were presented.
